所以, 

1. choose a few from above, and then list them on the page.
2. use accordion to show/hide the content of the projects
	-- image / screenshot: gallery mode
	-- brief text
	-- tools / process / duty
	
& call to action
-- reach out




(optional for release)
Side projects relevant? A separate page
- writings
- photographs
- simple designs

// what I need to do now
1. how will the accordion look
2. what is the best way to present the images (I think lightbox is one click too many? or if it's big enough...)
* (should I compile all of the above into PDF? or have a print as pdf button?)
